# translate("""The project is called QueryStorm. It uses Roslyn to offer C# (and VB.NET) support in Excel, as an alternative to VBA. I've posted about it before, but a lot has changed since then so figured I'd share an update.
# The current version includes a host of new features, namely a C# debugger, support for NuGet packages, and the ability to publish Excel extensions to an "AppStore" (which is essentially a NuGet repository). The AppStore can be used by anyone with the (free) runtime component.
# Another great addition is the community license, which is a free license for individuals and small companies to use. It unlocks most features, but it isn't intended for companies with more than 5 employees or over $1M in annual revenue.
# I would love to hear your feedback and am happy to answer any technical questions about how QueryStorm is implemented.""")
